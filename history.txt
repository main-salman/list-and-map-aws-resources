# AWS Resource Map Ref Debugging History

## Issue
The ResourceMap ref is not being properly initialized, leading to "ResourceMap ref not initialized" errors when trying to use export functions.

## Attempted Solutions

1. First Attempt - Basic Ref Forwarding
- Used simple forwardRef with direct ref passing
- Issue: Ref was null when component mounted
- Error: "ResourceMap ref not initialized"

2. Second Attempt - Dynamic Import Wrapper
- Created DynamicResourceMapWrapper to handle dynamic imports
- Added loading states and ref forwarding
- Issue: Ref still null after component mount
- Error persisted

3. Third Attempt - Multiple Component Chain
- Split into DynamicResourceMapLoader and DynamicResourceMapWrapper
- Added more ref forwarding checks
- Issue: Ref not propagating through component chain
- Error still present

4. Fourth Attempt - Ref Initialization Timing
- Added delays and initialization checks
- Added extensive logging
- Issue: Ref timing issues between mount and initialization

5. Fifth Attempt - State Management
- Added explicit state tracking for export methods
- Added multiple checks for method availability
- Issue: Methods available in wrapper but not in loader
- Error: "Map not ready" despite methods being present

6. Sixth Attempt - Hook Order Fix
- Fixed "Cannot access exportMethods before initialization" error
- Reordered hooks to ensure proper initialization
- Simplified debugging to reduce complexity
- Issue: Need to verify if this fixes the underlying ref issue

7. Seventh Attempt - Ref Chain Repair
- Fixed ref forwarding through ResourceMap component
- Added proper ref handling at each level
- Improved method forwarding
- Added better error handling
- Issue: Testing if this fixes the ref chain

## Current Understanding
- The ref chain was breaking at the ResourceMap level
- Each component needs to properly forward its methods
- Need to ensure refs are properly initialized before use
- Dynamic imports require careful ref handling

## Next Steps
1. Test the complete ref chain
2. Verify method forwarding at each level
3. Add error boundaries for safety
4. Consider adding retry mechanism
5. Add loading states for better UX
